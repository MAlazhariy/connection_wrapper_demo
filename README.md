# Internet Connection Management Package for Flutter (DEMO)

## Overview

This Flutter package is designed to manage internet connection outages seamlessly within applications. It ensures an uninterrupted user experience by implementing a reliable data-fetching mechanism that activates once the internet connection is restored.

The package is currently being utilized in my projects and will be publicly available soon after further modifications, improvements, and comprehensive documentation.

## Features

- **Actual Internet Connection Check:** Accurately detects the presence of an internet connection, beyond just verifying a Wi-Fi connection.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies implementation by reducing the need for extensive code on every page that requires internet connection checks, making it practical and user-friendly.
- **Customizable Widgets:** Displays the package's built-in widget or a custom widget when the internet connection is down, with periodic status updates when the connection is restored.
- **Builder Widget:** Provides a dedicated builder widget with parameters to display various internet connection statuses, allowing control over the display of specific widgets based on the connection state.
- **Automatic Data Fetching:** Implements custom functions that activate once the internet connection is restored. This feature enhances the user experience by eliminating the need to reload or reopen the application to fetch data, ensuring seamless operation even after outages.
